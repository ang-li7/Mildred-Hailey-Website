      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        The Mildred C. Hailey Tenant Organization is a civic association elected
        by its residents to represent their best interest. To the best of our
        ability, we work with families and partners to identify gaps in
        resources and coordinate to bring those resources to our community and
        discuss who can best fill these needs. Our mission is to help preserve
        and enhance the community we love, to ensure that the interests of the
        community are considered by state and local governments, and our
        partners, to safeguard the quality of life we all value. The Mildred C.
        Hailey Development (formerly Bromley Heath and Bickford) is named after
        our former long-term Executive Director and Leader Ms. Mildred C.
        Hailey. Ms. Hailey was a longtime activist who fought for civil and
        tenantsâ€™ rights. The Mildred C. Hailey development was built between
        1939 and 1942 on the Heath Street side to provide housing for families
        of naval personnel and later expanded to include Bromley Park
        (1949-1954) to house low-income elderly and families.
